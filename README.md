# HR Data Analytics Project
This repository hosts a People Analytics project using SQL. The data was loaded from a csv file to MySQL RDBMS. The data was then cleaned and then analysed.

# Overview
This repository contains a data analytics project focused on human resources (HR) data. The dataset comprises 22,214 rows and 13 columns, with information about employees, including their ID, age, name, hire date, department, and termination date if applicable. The data was originally in a CSV file but has been loaded into a MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for analysis.

# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data analysis on the HR dataset. The analysis aims to extract valuable insights and patterns related to employee information, such as turnover rates, departmental trends, and more. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we hope to provide actionable recommendations for HR decision-makers.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:

Employee ID: A unique identifier for each employee.
Age: The age of each employee.
Name: The name of the employee.
Hire Date: The date when the employee was hired.
Department: The department to which the employee belongs.
Termination Date: If applicable, the date when the employee left the company.
# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning and preprocessing phase to ensure data quality and consistency. The steps involved in data preparation include:

Handling missing data.
Correcting data types.
Removing duplicates.
Ensuring data consistency.
Validating date formats.
Handling outliers if necessary.
# Data Analysis
The core of this project revolves around data analysis. We explore various aspects of the HR data, including:

Employee Demographics: Understanding the age distribution and other demographic characteristics of employees.
Turnover Analysis: Analyzing turnover rates and identifying factors contributing to employee departures.
Departmental Insights: Examining department-specific trends and performance.
Tenure Analysis: Evaluating employee tenure and its impact on the organization.
Time Series Analysis: Exploring patterns over time, including hiring and termination trends.
